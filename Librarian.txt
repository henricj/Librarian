Note on subfolders inside archives:
----------------------------------
While some archive types support internal subdirectories, the support for this is still quite
rudimentary. Files in subfolders can be added by dropping an entire folder into the archive,
or one by one, using the "insert file as" feature.

Note that at this moment, there are no formats with subdirectories that actually support saving.
